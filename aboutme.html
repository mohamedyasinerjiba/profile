            <p>October 2023 - Present
                <p>My name is Mohamed Yasine Rjiba, and I am a second-year preparatory student majoring in economics and management at Hay Er-Romana School. I have a great passion for understanding the mechanisms of markets and global economies, and I aspire to develop my skills in economic analysis and business management to make a positive impact in this field.
                Through my studies, I have gained an intermediate knowledge of the principles of economics and management, and I am always working on improving my skills. I aim to use my education to make a difference in the community and contribute to enhancing economic growth.
                End I have little experience in programming.<p>
